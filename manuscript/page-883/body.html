when that she ran off from me. And I saw also the portion of the strap,
which she cut; and so all to be found.</p><p>And we went then at a good speed toward the river; for I was still
minded regarding the seeming of movement which there had been among the
trees; and very wishful that we have a raft made with haste, so that we
might come to the little island, where I did sleep before, upon the
outward way, as you shall remember. And I thought to have our slumber

sleeping.</p><p>And I told the Maid concerning the island; and she to be in great
delight and interest, because that it did be one of those halts of mine
outward going, and did be all eager as a child, when that I said we
should truly have need of a raft to come to the island.</p></div> </div>
