humble, and would be forgiven; but all to be in a naughty mockery; so
that, in verity, I lookt not at her, save odd whiles; but did go forward
alway, and made as that I had no heed of her doings.</p><p>And surely this did presently to stir her to a new defying and to a
pretty anger; for she did sing other songs of impudence, that she did
fit very clever about me; and this way to have a constant impertinence.</p></div> </div>
