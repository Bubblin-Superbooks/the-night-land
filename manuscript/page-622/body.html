the Land dipt downward into a broad valley; and surely it did be very
dark down there, and did be seeming shallow, yet truly of a great
deepness; but we went that way, because that it did be a weary long
journey to go around the place where the valley did be.</p><p>And the Valley had a different darkness from the gloom that went alway
in the olden sea-bed; for the gloom of the sea-bed did be ever of a
greyness; but the gloom of this Valley had a greater dark within it; yet
did the air seem more clear.</p><p>And we went downward three hours into the Valley, and stopt then that
we eat and drink; and truly I had not paused then; but that Mine Own did
insist; for our methods did be like, else, to go all adrift, and we to
be lacking of proper strength.</p></div> </div>
