scuttling of the monster scorpions; and mayhap a moving in the shadows
of the great boulders, that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar
monster in that place; so that I did be very wary, and to have the
Diskos alway ready.</p><p>And when the fourth day was come, I showed the Maid, in the sixth hour,
the ledge that did be my first sleeping place, when that I was entered
into the Gorge.</p><p>Now presently, in the eleventh hour, after that we had gone five hours
in a gloom, there did show afar off a shining; and I caught the Maid,
and I pointed; and she also to perceive that it did be surely the
shining of the light of that great Country that I did tell upon.</p><p>And immediately we did begin to run downward, and with sore stumblings
in this place and that; but not to halt us; for we did be so mad as two
children for the gladsome light.</p></div> </div>
