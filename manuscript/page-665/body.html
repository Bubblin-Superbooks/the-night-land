glad happiness and sweet trouble of her man; and that she did be a true
woman, and one part of the woman did worship, so that she did be
strangely humble and nigh to be shy; and another did love, and need that
she be anigh to me; and a third to have a calm wisdom. And all did now
be a-tremble, together in her heart; and I knew that I did be truly an
hero to her, though but usual to all others. And my heart was wondrous
proud and wondrous humble, so that I was in the same moment upraised and
to feel dreadly unworthy. But I made no pretending to discredit myself
to her, but only did resolve that I win alway her dear respect; and I
did be natural and truthful of my manner and without foolish denial of
her sweet worship, for she was utter Mine Own, and it did be a pitiful
thing if that I seem otherwise than an hero unto her.</p></div> </div>
