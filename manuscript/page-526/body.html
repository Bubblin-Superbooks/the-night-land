<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>And so shall you know the utter desolation that was in my heart; and,
truly, I can perceive both the wiseness and the unwisdom of my
reasonings; for, indeed, I did have no <em>sure</em> knowing that the dark
Pyramid did be truly the Lesser Refuge. But yet, in verity, my spirit
did know with a certain sureness, and there was no doubt concerning this
thing, in all my being.</p><p>And, after that I had sat there awhile, I did mind me suddenly that I
should send the Master-Word through the night; for, indeed, how else
might I ever know whether Naani did yet live; though, in truth, I had
little, save desperate hope in this matter; but yet did remember how
that I had seemed odd times of my journey to hear the beat of the
Master-Word with my spirit, out of all the dark of the world. And, in
verity, if Naani answered not to the Word, but there came instead an
Evil Power to destroy me, I should but cease me of mine utter
heart-ache.</p></div> </div>
