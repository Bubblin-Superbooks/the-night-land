<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">turn me and look back to the Mighty
Pyramid; and, in truth, though I had come a very good space, yet was I
so anigh to it, that I was both cheered and put out of heart; for it did
seem close upon me, by reason of its greatness, so that I, who had
journeyed a hard and weariful way, was shaken with the greatness of the
task that was upon me.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Yet was this but one side of my heart; for it was good to feel the
nearness of my Mighty Home; and I knew that there did countless millions
make watch upon me, as I sat; yet did I make no sign; for it is not meet
to make a constant farewell; but to GO. Yet was it very strange to be
thus near, and to show such behaviour as were proper to one afar from
all humanity. But so it was that I ordered my ways; for it did seem
proper to me; yet was I happy to know that the dear Master Monstruwacan
must, time and oft, have spied upon me through the Great Spy-Glass; and
mayhaps did watch me in that</p></div> </div>
