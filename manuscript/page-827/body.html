humble little heart, but only of the chance that her nature did be
stirred that way for the while.</p><p>And truly, when we were gone back, the foot-gear did be there to the
side of the pool, and the Maid gat shod very speedy, and would have no
aid; and afterward did up her hair very tight upon her head, to have it
utter from my sight; and this to be for a perverseness; for she knew
that I did love to see it pretty upon her shoulders, or if that she must
do it, that she do it up very loose and nice; and truly you to know how

to admirings, if that the thing be aright.</p><p>And I to say nothing, as I looked at her; and she presently to make a
quick glance unto me, to see why I did say naught. And I shook my head,
smiling at her waywardness; but she to look away from me, and to seem to
be set to fresh naughtiness.</p></div> </div>
