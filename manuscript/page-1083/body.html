be gone utter and forever in but a little minute. And the uncertainty of
the luminous vapour did cling about her, and to make her to seem unreal
to my gaze; for the vapour did be in constant movement, and to give a

strange hoarse noise from the nearer Millions. And lo! in an instant

made again, and did grow into a mighty hoarse roaring from the Millions,
so that all that great Country did be filled with the monstrous sound.

pain which did make me to be crazed and lost from all sane thinking.</p></div> </div>
