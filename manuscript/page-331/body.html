<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, when I was gat there, I was truly glad to think that there were no
serpents in that place; and because that I had slain the Monster of the
Place, how should it be that any harm might come unto me; for truly, was
it not like that a Creature of such Might should keep all that Hollow
unto itself, and slay any that did come therein, and thereby preserve
that place from all other horror; though, surely, until it did die and
cease to Be, there had been no call for any greater abomination.</p><p>Now, all this did go through my brain, as I did sit to dry mine armour
and my body and my gear, upon that side of the fire-hole which was away
from the slain Monster. And I made presently to think that this would
be a sure and proper refuge wherein to sleep; for, truly, it must have
gotten a place where none other Creature should be like to come to work
me harm. And it must be that you do all see with me in this matter, and
commend me that I thought with properness.</p></div> </div>
