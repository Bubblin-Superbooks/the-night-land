Monstruwacan did stand in full armour, and with the Diskos, to do me
honour, with the Full Watch, as I went forth. And I looked at him,
quietly, and he looked unto me, and I bent my head to show respect; and
he made silent salute with the Diskos; and afterwards I went onwards
towards the Great Gateway.</p><p>And they made dim the lights in the Great Causeway, that there should no
glare go forth into the Land, when the Gate was opened; and behold, they
opened not the lesser gate within the greater, for me; but did honour my
journey, in that they swung wide the Great Gate itself, through which a
monstrous army might pass. And there was an utter silence all about the
Gate; and in the hushed light the two thousand that made the Full Watch,
held up each the Diskos, silently, to make salute; and humbly, I held up
the Diskos reversed, and went forward into the Dark.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
