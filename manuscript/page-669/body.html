Gorge where we were come, and she had beside a rest of the soul, in that
she had feeling that there did be no Evil Force to trouble us to our
destruction; and I bothered her not yet awhile with tellings of the
horrid place that we should to journey through in a while, as you do
know.</p><p>And so we did go, and alway with a good caution, lest that some Beast or
Creature should come upon us; and alway with the fire-holes before and
behind, and in the air of the Gorge the little whistlings of steam that
did spirt out in this place and that; and a good warmth in many parts,
by reason of the fires; and odd whiles a smelling of sulphur; but not
greatly, nor to our trouble. And alway the low muttering of the
fire-holes and pits, and the red lights, and the dancing of the shadows
when that we did go by a fire-pit where the fire did frisk and burn
lively. And upon either side, the grim walls of the Gorge going up
measureless into the night.</p></div> </div>
