<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">thing yet to settle and twitch, as I did
look, as it did come properly unto death in all that mighty bulk. And
everywhere, the skin of the Beast did be set into great wrinklings, and
horrid blotchings to be upon the improper whiteness thereof; and truly I
did be in haste that I turn the Maid away from that thing, and that we
haste downward of the Gorge.</p><p>And we went then for two good hours, and alway I did hearten the Maid,
and she to go very husht and trustful by me; but truly I did be in an
anguish of heart, because that I was newly aware that there did be such
great and dreadful serpents in that part of the Gorge, as you do also
know. And I was not over-feared for myself, but for the Maid that did
have no armour to protect her dear body. And because that I was so set
with this trouble, I took the Maid presently into mine arms, that I
carry her, and so to have her clear of aught that should lie among the
boulders.</p></div> </div>
