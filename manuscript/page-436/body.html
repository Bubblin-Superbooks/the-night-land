journeyed to save from destruction. Yet, as you must see, always were my
thinkings brought sharply unto my going; so that scarce was I ever set
off to ponder upon Naani, but that there came some danger or wonder to
give me heed to my way. And because of this, as you have learned, I was
more put to plan free of the instant trouble and peril of my way,
through all that mighty journey, than to have quiet chance for thoughts
of love unto mine Own. Yet, truly, was not my journey one whole thought
of love unto Naani? And, that peril made oft dumb my brain, was but the
truer song unto my Maid.</p><p>And at times I was among trees; but oft did go past unnumbered boiling
springs and small fire-hills; and oft was the air full of the noise of
the little fire-hills, and the roar of the boiling springs; but there
came no harm unto me.</p></div> </div>
