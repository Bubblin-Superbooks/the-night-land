fire-pit; and we stoopt unto the earth; for it did seem that the light
did be like to show us standing there, though truly we did be afar off,
as you perceive. Yet, mayhaps, you do share with us the utter horror and
distress that those horrid Men did cast about the heart, and so have a
kindly understanding of our fear.</p><p>And over all the Land, in this place and that, there did be the small
shining of little fire-holes and pits, that did be alway red, save in
that part where the Poison Gas did lie, the which we had now come safe
past.</p><p>And beyond the fire-holes, was the great Shine, that lay from the West
unto the North of all that Land; and, in verity, we did need that we
steer so that we come not anigh to it, neither unto the Great Red
Fire-Pit of the Giants; neither unto the low volcanoes, which were
beyond the Great Red Fire-Pit, as you do know, and someways unto the
Mouth of the Upward Gorge.</p></div> </div>
