we came in the end safe into the cave; and truly we did feel very safe
and happy.</p><p>Yet, before we did sleep, I set free the scrip and the pouch, and took
the straps and went downward again into the Gorge; and I gat a good
boulder, so heavy as I might carry, and strapt it to my back, and came
upward again to the cave, and the Maid very grave and anxious, lest that
I slip to my hurt. And when I was come to the cave again, I set the
boulder in the mouth of the cave, and did balance it so light upon the
edge, that a touch should send it rolling downward.</p><p>And by this devising, I conceived that any Beast or Monstrous thing that
should climb upward whilst that we slept, should be like to set the
rock adrift, and mayhaps the rock to work an harm to such, but the
chief end to be that I should be swiftly waked by the noise.</p></div> </div>
