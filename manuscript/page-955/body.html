the Maid did be risen a good while, and had made her toilets, as I
perceived in a moment, when that she came unto me; for her hair did be
in a lovely cloud upon her shoulders, all combed and made ready against
my waking; and she to have bathed, as I supposed, in some warm pool that
did be among the bushes upon the island; and she now to slip her
foot-gear, that her feet be bare unto me, as I did love, and to stand a

pleasure in her heart, that I so to look upon her with holiness and with
natural love, and surely the last doth be unnatural if that it do lack
the first; but my love did burn upward out of my being, so that the
flame of my spirit did light the fires of my heart, and my Reason to add
coals unto that fire that hath lived for ever, and doth be as that</p></div> </div>
