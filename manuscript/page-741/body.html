right, and not to guess far off from the inward deepness of my heart.

this doth be all a contradiction, and the human heart to be a wayward
thing, whether it doth be of a man or of a woman.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And Naani, as I do think, to have loved the chafe of that rough garment
for love's sake, and to go very humble and loving, as I lookt at her;
but in verity to be never gone from the sweet naughtiness that did be
alway in her heart, and to plan even in that moment</p></div> </div>
