I cause us both to come to an harm by staying over-long in that Land.</p><p>And I went back into the stones, and gat an ointment from the pouch,
that I did carry. And surely the Maid did yet sleep. And I went outward
of the stones, again; and stript off the armour, and all my garments;
and I rubbed my body with the ointment, and surely the pain did be so
that I groaned at this time and that; but yet must I rub good and strong
so that I die not of the cold of the Land; and beside I was greatly
anxious to cure myself.</p><p>And sudden, as I did rub very strong and savage, and heeding so well as
I might that I groan not, the Maid did speak close beside me. And,
indeed, she could see me but dimly, and had waked sudden to hear my
groaning, and I was not to her side. And immediately she had thought
that some evil thing harmed me, and was come in an instant that she be
with me.</p></div> </div>
