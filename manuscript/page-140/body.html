<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Lesser Redoubt were in very deadly trouble; for
that the Earth-Current had failed suddenly and mightily; and they had
called her from her sleep, that she might listen whether we answered
their callings by the Instrument; but, indeed, no calling had come to
us.</p><p>And they who had been of late so joyful, were now grown old with sorrow
in but an hour or two; for they feared that the fresh coming of the
Earth-Current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the
end. And, even in this short while of our speech, did it seem to me that
the voice of Naani grew further off from me; and I felt like to have
broken my heart with the trouble of this thing.</p><p>And through all that remained of that sleep-time, did I converse with
Naani, as might two lovers who shall presently part forever. And when
the cities awoke, the news went throughout them, and all our millions
were in sorrow and trouble.</p></div> </div>
