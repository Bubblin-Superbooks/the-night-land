no sure knowing; yet have I put forward certain thoughts on this matter
in an earlier place; and more than such thinkings is surely vanity; for

that bath, which truly was nigh all gone backward into the earth. And I
dressed me again, and got my armour upon me, and afterward was I in a
more lightsome state of the mind; and yet very ready to come again unto
my sleep. And this I did, and had six hours more beside the pool; and
once was wakened somewhat by the gruntling and bubbling noise of the
water, that was made as the pool did fill time and again.</p><p>And when the six hours were gone, I waked very well fitted in my senses
and feelings to go forward again through that red-lighted Country, and
this I did, after that I had eat and drunk.</p></div> </div>
