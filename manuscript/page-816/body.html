transfigured, and to need strangely that she be in mine arms; and

be said I did have Mine Own, after that all Eternity had nigh past.</p><p>And, in verity, we ran each to the other, and did be silent, because

that did be in our hearts. And truly you to be with me in understanding;
for you too, mayhap, to have suffered thiswise of dumbness; even if that
it hath not been so great. But yet to make you to know.</p></div> </div>
