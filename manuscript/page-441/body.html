<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">lo! I did see that
there came up the rock two Humped Men; and they did climb very swift and
silent; and I perceived that they smelled me, and came to destroy me.
And I made ready the Diskos to do battle, and ceased not to look
downward. And I saw how that the Humped Men did seem to be humpt by
reason of their being so monstrous thick and mighty of the neck and the
shoulder, as that they had been human bulls. And I saw that they were
very strong, and by the speed of their climbing, I knew they were swift;
and so did I make steady my attention and my heart to the saving of my
life; for truly I did know that I should be dead in a little, or they.</p><p>Now I stept back a space from the edge of the rock, and had the Diskos
very ready; for it was needful that I should kill one of those brute men
speedy, that I have no danger that one take me in the back, whilst that
I fight with the other.</p></div> </div>
