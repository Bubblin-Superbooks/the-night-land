<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Doorways within the Night, I made
an especial care of my going; and did stop oft that I might listen, and
watch, and keep a very strict ward in all the Night about me. Yet, as
you shall see, this served not to prevent me from going forward into the
fearfulness of that which did haunt all the void; for, sudden, as I went
carefully, I heard a faint humming noise come downward from the night a
little unto my rear; and the humming noise did grow more plain, as that
a door were opened slowly above, and did let out that Sound ever more
loud. And surely, after I did hear that, I could not doubt that a door
were opened upward there; for the noise did grow in such wise as you
shall hear a distant sound come through, when a door truly is oped; for,
if the noise had been made just in that place, it had seemed to come
from there; but this Sound, though it did come <em>through</em> there, was as
that it did come outward from some far lost and foreign Eternity. And
this I do struggle always</p></div> </div>
