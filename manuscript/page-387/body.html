hundred books upon that Wonder of the Future, and be still lacking in
the half of all that there is to be told; and so do I try to have
courage to this my task, and to have no over-trouble, because that I do

Reason of <em>this</em> age doth blind within me somewhat the Knowledge that I
have concerning <em>that</em>; for, in verity, is it not but a natural thing to
