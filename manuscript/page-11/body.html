   And I cannot touch her hair,
   And I kneel to empty shadowsâ€”

   And among the flowers at night
   And from the brooks at sunrise
   And from the sea at sunset,
   And I answer with vain callings ..."</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was the Joy of the Sunset that brought us to speech. I was gone a

dear and strange gathering of the Dusk come over all</p></div> </div>
