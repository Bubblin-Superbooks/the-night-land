know love; though the name did be in their mouths, and they to have
belief that the sweet kernel did be in their hearts; but, in verity,
THIS to be love, that your life shall bound in you with abundance, and
joy dwell round you, and your spirit to live in a natural holiness with
the Beloved, and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that
shall never be lost of a lovely mystery that doth hold a perfect peace
each unto the need of the other; and all to be that there go round
about you a wonder and a splendour all the days and the nights that you
shall beâ€”the Man with the Woman, the Woman with the Man. And Shame to
be unborn, and all things to go natural and wholesome, out of an utter
greatness of understanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before
the Woman; and the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an utter
Companion and in the same time a glad Possession</p></div> </div>
