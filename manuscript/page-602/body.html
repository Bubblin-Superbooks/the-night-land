Land, I heard them bellowing, and afterward a far away screaming, that
did have a death note in it; and I knew that those dreadful brute-men
did be taking the life from some poor wild humans; and afterward there
did be the silence again.</p><p>And, surely, it did come to me with a fierce impatience of sorrow, that
those people did be without spirit of courage; else had they turned them
upon the giants, and slain them with their hands, even if that all had
died to compass that slaying; for, truly, they should all die anywise by
the giant-men; and they had died then with somewhat to comfort their
hate.</p><p>Yet, as I do know, the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt had long been born
of parents that were starved of the Earth-Current through an
hundred-thousand years and more, and because of this thing, they did
surely lack somewhat in all ways. Yet was Naani otherwise; but this not
to prove aught, save the rule, as we do say.</p></div> </div>
