since last that we eat; and we made halt, and eat and drank; and I
showed the Maid how that we should make a short journey that day, and
sleep, and so be ready to the horrid journey through the dark part of
the Gorge, where the Slugs did be.</p><p>And we made search then, that we have a safe place to our slumber; and
surely I perceived where we did be; for we came upon that same cave
where I did sleep after that I was come free of the Slugs; and that we
were come no farther, doth show how easy did be our present going, and
this you do know. And there did be the spring where I washed, and the
fire-hole anigh, and truly they were not like to be gone away, as you
shall say! Yet did we exclaim, very natural; for the Maid did be so deep
in interest of the matters of my coming, and to be at once that no other
place should serve for our rest and slumber.</p></div> </div>
