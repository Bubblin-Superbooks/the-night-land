night, and the glowing was pale and horrid. And there was no more any
sound of the Spinning; only there did be, as it were, the trunk of a
great tree, that did show in the glowing; and the trunk of the tree came
toward us across the darkness.</p><p>And I turned the Maid from the Tree, and she did flutter a little in my
hands, as I did know, scarce-knowing; for she perceived that she did be
going to die in that moment. And I had my body thus between the Evil
Thing and the Maid. And lo! the Tree came no more anigh to us; but went
backward, and the pale glowing did fade, and the Tree no more to be
seen.</p><p>And I cried unto the Maid, very husky, that we did live; for that the
Evil Power was gone off from us; but she answered not, and did be heavy
against me. And I held her, and lookt alway about us, lest the Tree come
in upon the other side.</p></div> </div>
