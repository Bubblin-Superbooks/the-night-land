<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">dainty maid, of an high and pure and
natural spirit; so that if you be old these days, even but the light
merriment of a passing maiden to bring a pain of wonderings and golden
memories upon your heart.</p><p>And presently, I saw that Mine Own put a little space between us, as the
naughtiness did work in her, as my heart to know; and she to be offward
from me a little. And she still to have no speech with me; but in a
little to begin that she sing in a low voice; and to have her pretty
body very upright and lithesome, and to go forward with a wondrous
dainty swing, so that my heart told me that she did all be stirred with
small thrillings of defiance unto me, and with thrillings of love; and
she to have the triumph of her Maidenhood and of her Womanhood, as it
were both to contend in her and to thrill upon her tongue, and to show
out the lilting and pretty warfare of her spirit that did go dancing and
dearly naughty in her breast.</p></div> </div>
