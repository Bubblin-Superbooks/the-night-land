with Mine Own; for, indeed, she did half to need that she be whipt unto
properness, as you shall think, that have seen how she did be thiswise
only because that her nature did be stirred strangely, and her Womanhood
and her Maidenhood to be all unto war, and in part to make a rebellion

wise and yet to show a dainty foolishness and a true naughtiness that
did make me to feel somewhat of a real anger; but yet did have me to
know that all my being did be stirred by her; so that I did think with
one thought that she did be very foolish, and with another that she did
be lovely wayward.</p></div> </div>
