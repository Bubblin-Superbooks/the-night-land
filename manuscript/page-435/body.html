some of the water; and afterward made an end of my voyage, and then did
take back my belts and straps from binding the trees, and so forward
again upon my way, and no more fearful of the Humped Men; for, surely, I
did think I had left them all upon the far shore of the river; though
afterward I minded me that they might grow likewise upon the two sides;
but yet was I only discovered by those upon the one, as you do know.</p><p>And all that day I went very swift, and past many strange matters and
did coast upon wonders oft. And at the sixth and the twelfth hours did I
eat and drink, as ever; and between the eighth and the fourteenth hours
did I come past two mighty fire-hills, that made all the Country to
tremble with their noise. And four times did monstrous creatures pass by
me; but I was swift hid, and came to no harm.</p></div> </div>
