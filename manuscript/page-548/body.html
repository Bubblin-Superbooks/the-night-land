was over sudden, I said four-and-eighty hours, which should be three
days and the half of a day of four hours and twenty; and this thing I
knew, because that I kept alway a very careful counting of the hours,
lest that I get all adrift, and know not how long I was taken to come to

slumber, and had done much and bitter work in that time; and before then
had been much lacking of rest, as you do know.</p><p>And, sudden the Maid cried out something, and tost the cloak from her,

her nakedness. And, in verity, I knew not how I was gone so strange; but
do see now that I was nigh to swoon for lack of slumber and rest.</p></div> </div>
