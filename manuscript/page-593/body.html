<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">you shall perceive the better how my heart and
brain did be contrary, when that I tell to you, now, how that I have
belief that my spirit did even then be subtly set to warn me. And, also,
as all do know, it doth be easy to forget this warning and that of
experience; by which saying, I do mean that, oft as I had come to know
the dangers that did be alway about the fire-holes, yet when I did be
far off from them, and Mine Own broken and a-shiver with the chill of
the Land, the danger did seem but a small thing and afar off from my
mind, and unreal; but the cold to be doubly real. Yet, when we did come
even unto the fire-hole, then did come again all about my heart the
truth of those dangers that had seemed, but a while gone, so little.
And, indeed, I do hope you perceive me in this thing, and how that I
strive alway to set unto you the utter truth, so that you shall go with
me all the way, and lend me your nice understanding.</p></div> </div>
