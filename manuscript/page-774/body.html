opposed to the bright-burning fire-hill that did be offward in the sea,
and had made me a warm light in that time when I did sleep in the tree,
as you do remember. And truly, as I shall here mind you, we did be past
seven hours coming to this place, from the part where the steam did be;
yet had I gone that space upon the outward way at a speed that was
greater; but truly I might not set so great a pace to the Maid, save,
mayhap, odd whiles; and this thing I beg that you have alway in your
mind, and so to understand why that we did be oft long upon this part of
the journey and that, by compare with mine outward going.</p><p>And, in verity, I had set off our hour for food, because that I saw we
did come nigh to the place where the tree did be; and I to know that the
Maid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place, and to know that
I did sleep there.</p></div> </div>
