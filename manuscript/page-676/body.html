before; for I was greatly stiff on my waking, as you shall think; but
she came not into mine arms presently, as I did hope; but only kist my

it did be as that her spirit kist mine, and all her being came unto me;
and she gave me but that one kiss, and afterward slipt her hands very
gentle from mine, and made to the gathering of our gear.</p></div> </div>
